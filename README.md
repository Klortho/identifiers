# Identifiers

A Java library for working with Identifiers of various resources.

## Data model

An IdSet holds a list of Identifiers that all refer to the
same resource. There are two types of resources, corresponding to two types of
Identifiers:

- Non-versioned identifiers (e.g. "PMC123456") refer to the abstract concept
  of some entity, independent of any revisions that it might undergo. This is
  analogous to a "work", as defined by the FRBR standard
  (http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/frbr.html), and this library uses
  that term.
- Versioned identifiers (e.g. "PMC123456.1") refer to a specific version of
  the entity as it existed at some point in time. This is analogous to the FRBR
  concept of "expression".

Note that at any given time, for a give work, there will be a "current" version.
So, for example, the journal article PMC123456 might have three versions, with
the current version being PMC132456.3. If so, then both
https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC123456 and
https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC123456.3 would resolve to the same
version of this article, but these identifier would not be considered equivalent,
since they still refer to different conceptual resources. The former refers
to "the *current* version", and the latter refers to "version 3".

A more complete example is the following PMC article, which has
three separate identifiers that refer to the *work*:

- PubMed ID (pmid): 17401604
- PMC ID (pmcid): PMC1868567
- DOI (doi): 10.1007/s10162-007-0081-z

There also exist sets of IDs that refer to specific versions (note that each
version can have multiple IDs). They are:

- Version 1: PMC1868567.1, mid:NIHMS20955, aiid:1868567
- Version 2: PMC1868567.2, aiid:1950588
- Version 3 (current): PMC1868567.3, aiid:2538359

Note that some types of identifiers (for example, pmcid's) have both
non-versioned (e.g. PMC1868567) and versioned (e.g. PMC1868567.2) forms.
Other types of identifiers do not have this characteristic. DOIs are always
(ostensibly) non-version-specific, whereas Manuscript IDs are
always version-specific.

As of the time of this writing, in the above example, the third version is
"current". So, both PMC1868567 and PMC1868567.3 will dereference to the same
digital object. Yet, they can't be considered equal, because
they refer to different semantic resources.

This library includes methods to determine when two identifiers are "the same",
in a number of different scopes. For completeness, they are listed here
combined with the Java equality concepts.

- `===` - identical; the two Java variables refer to the same object in memory
- `.equals()` - the two Java objects are completely interchangeable
- `.same()` - the two Ids refer to the same resource: either both are
    non-versioned identifiers, or both are versioned. For example:
    `PMC1868567.1`.same(`mid:NIHMS20955`) would be *true*.
- `.sameExpression()` - at the time this is invoked, the two Ids dereference
    to the same digital object.
- `.sameWork()` - the two Ids are both valid identifiers in the complete set
    of identifiers for a given *work*.

There are two subclasses of `IdSet`: `NonVersionedIdSet` and `VersionedIdSet`,
that store these different types of IDs, and a parent-child relationship
between them. A given `IdNonVersionedSet` can have zero-to-many
`IdVersionedSet` children.


## Building

This library uses the Maven build tool. To create a fresh build of the
distribution package and the documentation, run:

```
mvn clean verify site
```

That command causes Maven to execute the steps for three goals in succession.

* `clean` -  results of previous builds are removed
* `verify` - downloads dependencies, compiles, tests, packages, and then
  verifies the package
* `site` - generates reports in the form of a set of web pages, in target/site

You can view the reports by opening them directly (as files) in your browser,
or you could run `mvn site:run` to start a local static HTTP server. The
server makes the reports available at http://localhost:8080/.

## Testing

To run all of the unit tests from the command line:

```
mvn test
```

To run just one specific set of tests (all the tests defined in the TestRequests
class):

```
mvn -Dtest=TestIdSet test
```

To run a single method of a test class:

```
mvn -Dtest=TestIdSet#testConstructorVer test
```

To run a test without compiling all of the other, unaffected classes and members
of the repository, specify the lifecycle phase explicitly as `surefire:test`.
(This is useful if you want to run a unit test on a class you're working on,
but there are compile-time errors in other files.)

```
mvn -Dtest=TestIdSet surefire:test
```

You can use wildcards; for example:

```
mvn '-Dtest=Test*' test
mvn -Dtest='*Req*' test
```

See the documentation of the [Maven Surefire
plugin](http://maven.apache.org/surefire/maven-surefire-plugin/),
for more options.


### Logging tests

When testing, the logger gets its configuration from
src/test/resources/log4j.properties.

When this is used as a library, the application is responsible for configuring
the logs. If nothing is specified, these log methods default to "no-op".


## Configuration

This library uses the [typesafehub
Config](https://typesafehub.github.io/config/) library for configuration,
which affords several ways of specifying configuration metadata.

The library defaults are set in src/main/resources/reference.conf.

Typically, an application will override configuration values for this library
in its own application.conf file, and then initialize it with:

```java
import com.typesafe.config.Config;
import gov.ncbi.ids.IdDb;

public class MyApp {
    private config;
    public MyApp() {
        config = ConfigFactory.load();
        IdDb iddb = new IdDb(config);
        ...
    }
}
```

When using the above pattern, System properties will override the application's
settings. So, for example, you could override a setting from the the command
line with:

```
mvn -Dcache-enabled=true test
```


### Findbugs

Enter the following to bring up a GUI application to browse the results
of the findbugs tests:

```
mvn findbugs:gui
```


## Dependencies

Below is a list of some of the stable dependencies, along with links to
documentation, useful when doing development, and more details, where
warranted.

Several of the dependencies use a free third-party service
[Jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/) in order to freeze specific revisions
from GitHub repositories. These are libraries that are not on Maven
Central, and Jitpack.io provides a way to ensure that we are using a
stable version. This requires adding the following to the \<repositories>
section of the pom:


### Java

Requires Java version 8.

* Platform / library [Javadocs](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/)

### PMC ID Converter API

* [Documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/id-converter-api/)

### Jackson

We're using the Jackson library to read JSON objects. Here are some
handy links:

* [Home page](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome)
* [Data binding](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) - includes
  tutorial on how to use it.
* [Javadocs](http://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.3.0/)
* [Jackson annotations](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-annotations) -
  how to annotate the classes that map to JSON objects

### kitty-cache

The library is on Google code
[here](https://code.google.com/p/kitty-cache/), and is also mirrored to
GitHub, at [treeder/kitty-cache](https://github.com/treeder/kitty-cache),
but it is not in Maven Central.

It is declared in the citation-exporter pom.xml, using
[JitPack.io](https://jitpack.io) to build and deploy it from a fork of the
repository on GitHub, at
[Klortho/kitty-cache](https://github.com/Klortho/kitty-cache).
(The reason for using a fork is to protect against the possibility of the
original repo being removed.)
